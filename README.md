# Blue Moon City
Blue Moon CIty Board Game

With love for t e p x a. For us by us.

WIP. Will add more as they come.
Aiming to be online on like heroku Î¿r such, and add features as the time comes,
apart from the obvious account creation and actual gameplay.
Perhaps in game chatting (also video??), leaderboards, badges, pause/resume game, for chats
use signal API, robust user session handling, offline messaging perhaps via email,
dont know i am just riffing now, most prob this will never see the light of day.

also would like to build an android app if this actually moves ahead.
